Yes! Including examples of objects like class, item, and equipment structures would be helpful for whoever is implementing the UI, ensuring they understand what kind of data the UI needs to display and interact with.

### **Project Specification: UI for AI-Driven Text Adventure Game**

#### **Overview**
The goal is to create a **text-based adventure game UI** where an **AI acts as the Game Master (GM)**, similar to AI Dungeon but with more structured gameplay mechanics. The UI will serve as a **frontend** that can be hooked up to the game engine backend.

The UI should be **text-based** and focus on **immersive storytelling** while allowing structured interactions with **inventory, character details, class info, and world descriptions**.

### **UI Layout & Features**

#### **1. Main Window**
- Displays the ongoing story.
- Below it: **Text input field** for roleplaying actions.
- Submit button to send actions to the GM.

#### **2. GM & Log Chatbox (Right Side)**
- A smaller chatbox displaying **the GM’s responses and game logs**.
- Below it: **OOC (Out-of-Character) Chat Input Field** for private conversations with the GM.
- Submit button to send messages directly to the GM.

#### **3. Inventory Panel (Below GM Chat)**
- A simple **list of item names** (text-only, no images).
- Hovering over an item **displays item details**.
- Clicking an item opens a **menu of actions**, including:
  - **Examine** → Opens a popup window with item details.
  - **Use** → Calls an action in the backend.
  - **Drop** → Removes the item from the inventory.
  - **Equip** (if applicable) → Moves the item to the Equipment panel.

#### **4. Character Button (Opens Character Window)**
A new window containing **three sections:**
1. **Items & Equipment** (default)
   - **Left Panel:** Displays equipped gear in predefined slots:
     ```
     'head', 'chest', 'legs', 'hands', 'feet', 'main_hand', 'off_hand', 'two_handed', 'accessories'
     ```
   - **Right Panel:** Displays inventory with interactive items.

2. **Class**
   - Shows a structured description of the character’s class, including abilities, stats, and lore.

3. **World**
   - Displays descriptions of **current location** and **surrounding areas**.

I've updated the project spec to include the **status bar**. Here's the revised section:

### **5. Status Bar (Persistent UI Element)**
- **Displays at all times**, likely at the top or bottom of the UI.
- Shows:
  - **Health** (e.g., `75/100`)
  - **Mana** (e.g., `40/50`)
  - **Stamina** (e.g., `60/80`)
  - **Time of Day** (e.g., `Dusk`, `Midnight`, `Early Morning`)
- Health, mana, and Stamina should be show as colour-coded bars
- **Time of Day** is a **simple text indicator** but can have **multiple possible values** rather than just "Morning", "Afternoon", and "Night".
- **Dynamically updated** by the backend when stats change.

---

### **Technical Considerations**
- The UI will be **independent from backend logic**, serving as a frontend to be hooked up later.
- **No backend processing for game mechanics yet**, just UI interactions.
- Items and equipment should be displayed **as text-based lists**, avoiding graphics-heavy elements.
- Equipment logic (e.g., restricting main_hand & two_handed simultaneously) can be **handled by the backend**, not the UI.

### Data/Class Examples

See data/class examples in the specs folder:
- item.json
- equipment_item.json
- character_class_reference.py
- character_reference_spec.py

These are just a rough guide/reference for what the backend objects might look like, that will eventually feed data through to the UI.
